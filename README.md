# Balatro-Bot
A bot/script that's designed to beat the card gambling roguelike game by Playstick Games, Balatro. The purpose of creating this is to have a main project for me to learn more algorithms, have something to attempt to make more efficient, and be a specific project that showcases my programming skills. Written all in Python and gaining information on the game using OpenGL and Tesseract, it requires no connection to the game itself for it to know what's on the screen.

## Features
- Able to identify the Balatro window by itself and set it up, along with starting a new run and essentially starting playing the game.
- Can identify all cards, jokers, booster packs, and other things in the game without needing to access the program memory.
- Plays the game, using almost all aspects of the game, including using items, buying stuff from the shop, and using discards.
- Takes preferences with specific cards and other things using weighted relations taken from a CSV file.

## How to install/use

1. Install Balatro from anywhere and Tesseract.
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://www.github.com/raienelliston/Balatro-Bot.git```
3. Add your settings in the config.txt
4. Run the commands below
